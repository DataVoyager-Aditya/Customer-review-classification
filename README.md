I developed a sophisticated customer review classification model utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze and categorize feedback from users effectively. This project aims to automatically classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, enabling businesses to gain actionable insights into customer sentiments and improve their products or services. The model processes text data by employing RNN architecture, which excels in handling sequential information. By training on a comprehensive dataset of labeled customer reviews, the RNN learns to identify patterns and context within the text, allowing it to understand nuances in language that traditional classification methods may overlook. I implemented techniques such as word embeddings to convert textual data into numerical representations, enhancing the model's ability to capture semantic meaning
